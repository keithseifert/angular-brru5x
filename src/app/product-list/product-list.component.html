<!-- In the app.module we declared this route  path: 'products/:productId', component: ProductDetailsComponent   and here we added a router link so that this anchor will do to
      the ProductDetailsComponent because it sees path /product and appends the product id so 
      we can look up the product in that component-->

      {{ product.name }}

  <!-- this button is bound to the share function in the ts file for this component -->

  <button type="button" (click)="share()">Share</button>

  <!-- we are in a for loop where product is the var name of each product in the
  list // as we loop, so here we are creating an alert component and passing the
  product as input. The alerts component emits an event using a variable named notify
  so here we call the OnNotify function when we get (notify) -->
